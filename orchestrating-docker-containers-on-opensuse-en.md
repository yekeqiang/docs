# Orchestrating Docker Containers on openSUSE

A couple of weeks ago the 11th edition of SUSE’s [hackweek](https://hackweek.suse.com/) took place. This year I decided to spend this time to look into the different orchestration and service discovery tools build around Docker.

In the beginning I looked into the [kubernetes](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes) project. I found it really promising but AFAIK not yet ready to be used. It’s still in its early days and it’s in constant evolution. I will surely keep looking into it.

I also looked into other projects like [consul](https://consul.io/) and [geard](http://openshift.github.io/geard/) but then I focused on using [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) and [fleet](https://github.com/coreos/fleet), two of the tools part of [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/).

I ended up creating a small testing environment that is capable of running a simple guestbook web application talking with a MongoDB database. Both the web application and the database are shipped as Docker images running on a small cluster.

The whole environment is created by [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). That project proved to be also a nice excuse to play with this tool. I found Vagrant to be really useful.

You can find all the files and instructions required to reproduce my experiments inside of [this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/flavio/docker-orchestration-demo).

Happy hacking!
