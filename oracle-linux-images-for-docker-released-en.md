The Oracle Linux team is pleased to announce an update to Docker on Oracle Linux, along with the release of official Docker images for Oracle Linux 6 and 7. With this update, customers will have access to the tools needed to create, manage and deploy Docker containers on Oracle Linux.

The Docker Engine and Official Oracle Linux images are fully supported as part of Oracle Linux Basic and Premier support subscriptions. The scope of Oracle Linux support for Docker can be found in My Oracle Support, Document ID 1921163.1.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.

You can learn more about using Docker on Oracle Linux in the [Oracle Linux Administrator's Solutions Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E37355/html/index.html) for [Oracle Linux 6](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E37355/html/ol_docker.html) and the [Oracle Linux Administrator's Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E52668_01/E54669/html/index.html) for [Oracle Linux 7](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E52668_01/E54669/html/ol7-docker.html).

You can install Docker for Oracle Linux from the Add-ons Channel for Oracle Linux 6 and 7, either via the [Unbreakable Linux Network](https://linux.oracle.com/) or the [Oracle Public Yum Server](http://public-yum.oracle.com/). 

You can browse the available Docker Images on the Oracle Public Yum Server at [http://public-yum.oracle.com/docker-images/](http://public-yum.oracle.com/docker-images/).
